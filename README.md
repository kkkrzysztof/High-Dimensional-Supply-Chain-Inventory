# About the Project

This is a BI/Analytics project done based on the Kaggle dataset entitled "[High-Dimensional Supply Chain Inventory Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/high-dimensional-supply-chain-inventory-dataset/data)."

# About the Dataset

Based on the information from the [original dataset source repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/high-dimensional-supply-chain-inventory-dataset/data), here is the (mostly sourced) interpretation of the columns in the dataset:

1. **Date:** Daily timestamps spanning one year of activity.
2. **SKU-Level Detail:** Unique product identifiers (ID) with varying demand patterns.
3. **Warehouse and Region:** Spatial dimensions representing distribution networks.
4. **Units Sold:** Number of units sold in a day (simulated with seasonal trends and random noise).
5. **Inventory Levels:** Dynamic on-hand stock that evolves over time.
6. **Supplier Lead Times:** Variable delivery delays for replenishment orders.
7. **Reorder Points and Quantities:** Inventory policy thresholds and simulated replenishments.
8. **Promotions:** Binary indicator of promotional periods influencing demand.
9. **Stockout Events:** Flags indicating when demand exceeds available inventory.
10. **Supplier Information:** Links products to specific suppliers with unique lead times.
11. **Cost and Price:** Realistic unit costs and selling prices with profit margins.
12. **Forecasted Demand:** Approximate prediction values reflecting planning estimates.
